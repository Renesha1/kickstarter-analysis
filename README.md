##### "An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns."
## "Overview of Project"
# Purpose
  Louise recently conducted a play and wants to compare launch dates and goals to help her choose a better path for reaching her goal for her next campaign. The analysis of the data provided will help Louise invision and help her make a decision on the best route for starting her play by providing different outlooks by utilizing different columns of data to produce comparable outcomes. 
# "Analysis and Challenges"
  I performed my analysis by analyzing the data by filtering the information that was provided by creating pivot tables, charts, and graphs, which made it easier to analyze.
# Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
  While completing this analysis, I ran into a few challenges that brought me to a hault a couple of times. I had an issue with the =Countifs function. It took time and research to figure out what I was doing wrong because I knew the calculations were not correct. I figured out that I was entering the wrong data columns in the function. I also spent time trying to figure out why my Outcomes_vs_goals graph did not show the true failed line data. The failed line on my graph showed the same as the canceled data, which did not match the data on the chart. I did try to research and resolve the issue by looking up videos on youtube.

## Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
  According to the line graph created, the successful outcomes skyrocketed between April and May and begin to decline consistently in June and incresed slightly between September and October and begin to decline the remainder of the year. As successful outcomes rose between March and May so did the number of failed outcomes. The graph also shows the more successful outcomes the more failed outcomes were still less. 
  
## Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
  The line graph and chart implicated as the goal amount increased the failed outcomes increased. 
  
## Results
  Some limitations of this data set is currency is different for some countries therefore the calculated data may not be accurate. It would be helpful to have the number of participants for each campaign and how much the tickets were sold for to compare how many people attended for each campaign.
  A pivot table and graph can be created to show the best outcome of the theatre parent category to see what subcategory acheived and succeeded the goals. 
  A table and graph could be created to show which country had the most increased succesful outcomes between the years 2014 through 2016.
